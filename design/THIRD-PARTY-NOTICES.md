Tundra is an adaptation for a single-owner, hardware-only wallet. Changes include its descriptor-import workflow, single-sig/2-of-3 interaction, customized orange/neutral semantic tokens, dark-first appearance control, session-only imported configurations, labeled-coin selection and consolidation, and simulation-only payment behavior. It does not bundle a Figma file or imply endorsement by the Bitcoin Design Community.

## Bitcoin Core App color reference

https://bitcoincore.app/colors/ informed the orange and neutral palette. This prototype uses the documented orange values as a starting point with its own text, surface, and contrast adjustments.

## Bitcoin Icons

The wallet outline path in `app.js` is adapted from Bitcoin Icons by the Bitcoin Design Community and contributors, with a stroke-weight adjustment.
